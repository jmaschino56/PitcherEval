# PitcherEval
Used to evaluate differences in effective velocity, release point, break, pitch location, and resulting launch angle/exit velocity.
Uses PyBaseball & MatplotLib mainly to get data from Baseball Savant, and outputs a table comparing Before/After and 3 seperate charts.
An example of this in use can be found here: https://bsblblog.home.blog/
